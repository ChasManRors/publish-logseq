- What is **deep learning** - learns a function
	- **Deep neural networks** - it figures the function - it is an input output sort of thing
		- Def: means it has more than 1 level
			- it must know what the output should be
		- somebody applied category theory to these networks
		- Category theory
			- Is about structure and composition
	- **Reinforcement Learning** - used together with Deep Learning - computes a payoff function
		- Can have a deep neural networks
		- [#A] it is self learning
		- Trained by learning episodes
			- Eg trained by playing chess
		- Def: learning takes place by giving rewards or punishments
		- learns a set of actions to to maximize a reward
		- Q function
			- given a state and an action it says how good that choice is
		- exploytation vs explore
			- explore - for training mode
				- choose things at random
			- exployt - always take the highest Q value

	- recurrent neural network is similar to a deep neural network version of #[[hidden marchov model]]
	- the transformer model takes the whole sentence at onceK
